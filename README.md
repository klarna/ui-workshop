Here you find the setup to run the examples that are going to be demonstrated in the UI Workshop in the KonferenSE 2016. 

To start:

1. Make sure you have [Latest Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.

2. Clone this repo somewhere handy (like your `Desktop` directory): 

  `git clone https://github.com/klarna/ui-workshop`

3. Enter the directory:

  `cd ui-workshop`

4. Install the node modules:

  `npm install`

5. Start the project:

  `npm start`

6. Go to the `http://localhost:2016/` and you will find the basic example.

## Useful tools

- Get syntax highlighting for JSX files: since we are going to work heavily on JSX, it is very practical for you to have a syntax highlighter for that file type in your editor. 
  - For [Atom, the `language-babel` package](https://atom.io/packages/language-babel)
  - For [Sublime Text, the Babel package](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Babel)
